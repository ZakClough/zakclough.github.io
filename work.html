            <p>this image was created using html canvas. I used an image on Google and traced it using canvas. I also added a few extra effects like a gradient in the background to make the image look better.</p>

            <p>This game was originally created as a school project. In this project, we had to create a website or a graphic that proved that we are willing and capable of going into our desired path of study. This started out as a last minute project that I scrambled together in a couple hours for this project. Since then, I have been working on updating the game and improving it. Recently I have teamed up with a few students and we are reworking the game to make it better.</p>

            <p>This webste was created as a school project. We were given a website and we had to create our own design for one of the pages on that site. The website the we were given was a website that advertises condos for rent. If I were to redo it, I would change te color scheme and rework the entire layout of the website. </p>

            <p>This website was a school proect where we had to recreate a few pages from the Apple website. Our job was to copy the apple website starting from a fresh program. The visuals were borrowed from the resource elements in the apple website.</p>

            <p>This website was created as a school project. We were given a website that was poorly designed and we had to create a new website with a better layout using the content of the original site. This website was made using worpress. Wordpress made the designing process of the website much easier which allowed me to focus on the functionality of the website rather than worrying too much about the design.</p>
